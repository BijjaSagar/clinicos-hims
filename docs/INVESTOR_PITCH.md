# ClinicOS — Investor Pitch

### The Operating System for India's 1.3 Million Specialty Clinics

---

## The Opportunity

India has **1.3 million registered clinics** — dermatology, dental, physiotherapy, ophthalmology, ENT, gynaecology, orthopaedics — and 93% of them run on paper registers, WhatsApp groups, and Excel sheets.

The Indian healthcare IT market is **$3.4 billion today and growing at 22% CAGR**. Yet no dominant EMR player has cracked the specialty clinic segment at scale. The existing solutions are either:
- Built for hospitals (too complex, too expensive)
- Built for general practice (no specialty depth)
- Built for Western markets (no GST, no ABDM, no Indian drug database)

**This is a $600M+ revenue opportunity that is essentially uncontested.**

---

## The Problem

A dermatologist in Pune spends:
- 45 min/day writing paper prescriptions
- 30 min/day chasing appointment confirmations on WhatsApp
- 20 min/day tracking payments manually
- 15 min/day looking up drug names

That's **2 hours of clinical time wasted every day** — time that could be seeing 4–6 more patients.

At ₹500 average consultation fee × 5 extra consultations × 250 working days = **₹6.25 lakh additional revenue per doctor per year** that ClinicOS enables.

---

## The Solution

**ClinicOS** is a multi-tenant SaaS EMR platform built exclusively for Indian specialty clinics.

Built on 3 core principles:
1. **Specialty-first** — purpose-built templates for each specialty, not generic forms
2. **India-first** — ABDM/ABHA compliant, GST invoicing, Indian drug database, Razorpay payments, WhatsApp automation
3. **Automation-first** — WhatsApp reminders, AI dictation, automatic payment reconciliation

## Market Sizing

| Segment | Clinics | Addressable |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Dermatology | 180,000 | High — specialty-specific tools |
| Dental | 320,000 | High — FDI chart is a must-have |

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Phase 1 — Dermatology Beachhead (Months 1–12)
- India has 12,000 practicing dermatologists, highly concentrated in metros
- ClinicOS has the deepest dermatology EMR of any Indian product
- Target through: Indian Association of Dermatologists (IADVL), dermat conferences, Instagram/YouTube ads targeting clinic owners
- Goal: 500 paying clinics

### Phase 2 — Dental & Ophthalmology Expansion (Months 6–18)
- Dental and ophthalmology are the next highest-density specialties
- Partnership with dental college alumni networks and IOS (Indian Ophthalmology Society)
- Goal: 2,000 paying clinics

### Phase 3 — Clinic Chain Segment (Months 12–24)
- Group/Enterprise plan targeting chains like Dr. Batra's, Vision Express, Fortis outpatient
- Significantly higher ARPU (₹10,000–50,000/month per chain)
- Goal: 50 enterprise accounts + 5,000 SMB clinics

### Phase 4 — Hospital HIMS & Vertical Modules (Months 18–36)
- **Hospital tenant tier** (not only clinics): minimum commercial SKU from **~50 licensed beds**, with **super-admin–configurable bed count** per customer (no arbitrary product ceiling—billing follows license).
- **OPD at hospital scale:** multi-department queues, consultant rosters, tighter handoff to inpatient and billing.
- **IPD:** admissions, transfers, discharges, **bed board**, ward activity, nursing documentation, IPD charges, discharge summary.
- **Full LIS:** in-house lab operations (samples, QC, instruments, verified results)—beyond today’s outbound lab partner integrations.
- **Pharmacy:** inpatient/outpatient dispensing, stock, purchase, formulary, returns/expiry, linked to prescriptions and wards.
- **India first; then global:** same core codebase with **localization packs** for **US** (e.g. HIPAA-oriented controls, US coding/billing patterns) and markets such as **Malaysia** (language, currency, local reporting hooks)—after India GA.

*Market reference:* Custom healthcare software and EHR vendors (e.g. engineering partners like [Thinkitive](https://www.thinkitive.com/) in custom healthcare / interoperability) show the depth of workflow and integration hospital clients expect; ClinicOS targets that depth in a **productized** multi-tenant platform.

### Distribution Channels
- **Direct / self-serve** — online signup, 14-day trial, credit card
- **Medical reps / channel partners** — commission-based sales in Tier 2/3 cities
- **Medical associations** — bulk licensing deals with IADVL, IDA, etc.
- **Hostinger/cloud resellers** — bundled with hosting for new clinics

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Weakness vs. ClinicOS |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Practo** | Appointment booking only — no deep EMR, no specialty templates |
| **Dr. Vaidya / eVitalRx** | Pharmacy-focused, not clinic EMR |
| **Marg ERP** | Desktop billing software, not cloud EMR |
| **Healthplix** | General practice focus, limited specialty depth |
| **DrChrono / Epic** | US-built, no ABDM, no GST, no Indian drug database |
| **HealthDesk** | Limited automation, no WhatsApp, no specialty templates |
| **Legacy HIMS vendors** | Often on-prem, long deployments; weak specialty UX | ClinicOS cloud-native, specialty-first, then **hospital tier** with LIS/IPD/Pharma |

**ClinicOS moat (today):** ABDM alignment + WhatsApp automation + specialty depth + Indian drug database + Razorpay — one platform hardened for India. **Tomorrow:** same stack scales to **hospital HIMS** and **international packs** without forking the product.

---

## The Ask

**Raising: ₹3 Crore (Seed Round)**

| Use of Funds | Amount | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Engineering (4 engineers × 12 months) | ₹1.2 Cr | ABDM M2 cert, AI features, mobile app |
| Sales & Marketing | ₹0.8 Cr | Dermatology conference circuit, digital ads |
| ABDM Certification & Compliance | ₹0.3 Cr | NHA sandbox → production |
| Drug Database License (CIMS) | ₹0.2 Cr | ₹1.8L/year full Indian drug DB |
| Infrastructure & Ops | ₹0.3 Cr | AWS, WhatsApp Business API setup |
| Working Capital | ₹0.2 Cr | |

**Target: 3,000 paying clinics, ₹5.76 Cr ARR by end of Year 2**

---

## Why Now?

1. **ABDM mandate** — Government of India's Digital Health Mission requires all clinics to support ABHA by 2025. Compliance creates a forcing function for clinic software adoption.

2. **WhatsApp Business API maturity** — Meta opened the Cloud API in India in 2022. The unit economics for automated patient communication now work at scale.

3. **Post-COVID digitization** — 68% of Indian clinic owners surveyed in 2024 say they plan to adopt clinic management software in the next 12 months (FICCI Healthcare Report 2024).

4. **AI tailwind** — Voice-to-EMR eliminates the last major friction in EMR adoption for older doctors. Hindi-English dictation makes it viable for Tier 2/3 markets.
